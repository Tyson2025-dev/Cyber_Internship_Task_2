# Observations
- A recent phishing email example involves a fake Stanford University message with a QR code embedded in a PDF attachment.

The email, sent from a self-addressed sender, uses the subject line "Stanford Action required: Kindly Update Promptly - Employee ID-7597555367237216985958244" and is designed to harvest credentials. The downloadable file, named "Stanford.pdf," contains a QR code that redirects to a malicious URL—https://brightnationti.eu/DL8WZbP56/#username@stanford.edu—which resolves to a credential-harvesting page.

Each link is uniquely crafted with the recipient’s username, increasing the personalization and effectiveness of the attack.
